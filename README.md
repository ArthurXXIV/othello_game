# Definition
Othello is a two-player strategy board game The game is played on an 8x8 grid and is named after the famous Shakespearean play "Othello," where the central theme is the concept of reversals. Creating an Othello game with AI involves developing an AI player that can make intelligent moves and compete against human players or other AI opponents.  AI players for Othello typically use algorithms and techniques such as minimax search with alpha-beta pruning, heuristics, and machine learning to make informed decisions about where to place their pieces on the board.

Its a multiplayer game where players try to tap and collect more pieces than their opponent
To set up the game place four pieces in the center squares on the board so two of the pieces are white side up and two of the pieces are black side up woth the matching colours diagonal from each other

## OBJECTIVE
The primary objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive Othello game with a graphical user interface (GUI) that provides a rich gaming experience. 
The objective of Othello is to have the majority of your coloured discs (either black or white) on the board at the end of the game. The game ends when the board is full or when no more valid moves can be made.
Scoring and Win Condition: Implement a scoring system that tracks the number of pieces for each player and determines the winner based on the final score. The game should declare a winner when the board is full or when no more valid moves can be made.
Real-time Updates: The graphical representation of the game board is continuously updated, making it easy for players to follow the game's progress.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): Create an engaging and user-friendly interface using a graphical library (e.g., Tkinter) to enable players to interact with the game intuitively. The GUI includes a visually appealing game board, interactive piece placement, and a clear display of game status.

## Setup
•	The game board consists of an 8x8 grid, with an initial setup of four discs placed in the center.
•	Two black discs are placed on squares d4 and e5, and two white discs are placed on squares d5 and e4.
## Gameplay:
•	Players take turns to place one of their discs on the board.
•	When a player places a disc, they must place it adjacent to an opponent's disc in such a way that there is a straight line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) between the new disc and one or more of their own discs. The opponent's discs in the line are then flipped to the player's color.
•	Players must make a move if they have a valid one. If a player cannot make a legal move, they must pass, and their opponent continues.
## Winning:
•	The game ends when the board is full or when no more valid moves can be made.
•	The player with the most discs of their color on the board at the end of the game wins.


# CONCLUSION:
Othello is a game that combines tactical and strategic thinking. Players must be attentive to the current state of the board and anticipate the potential consequences of their moves. The game can be played casually or taken to a competitive level, making it a timeless classic in the world of strategy board games.

Room for Expansion: The project lays the foundation for further development. Future enhancements might include difficulty levels for the AI, additional graphical effects, sound, and multiplayer functionality.
